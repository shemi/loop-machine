# Loop Machine


### Create a 9 pad loop machine:

1. Create 9 pads (squared) view with 2 states, on and off changed by click.
2. Add play and stop buttons to control the global loop - they should stop/play all active loops immediately.
3. Each square should present a loop sample
4. All playing loops should start together at the same point - When a pad is turned on, it should start playing its loop on the next loop cycle, not immediately. Also, repeat the
   loop as long as the pad is on.
5. Make sure to avoid any delay in order to be synched
6. When a pad is turned off, it should stop playing immediately.
7. The provided loops are 8 seconds long.
